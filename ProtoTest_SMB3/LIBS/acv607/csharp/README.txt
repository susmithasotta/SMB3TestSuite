ASN1C V6.0 C# RUN-TIME


This README file contains information on the C# Run-Time components add-on 
for ASN1C V6.0. 

DOCUMENTATION
   The following documentation is available on using the C# run-time 
   code generated by ASN1C: 
   
   ASN1C for C# User's Manual This is located online at the following 
   link:
   
   http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/documents.shtml 
     
   The MSDN style ASN1C C# runtime library documentation can be accessed through 
   the ASN1C library.chm file in the csharp/doc subdirectory. 
    

Microsoft .Net SUPPORT

   The ASN1C run-time library is built with Microsoft .Net 2005 / 2.0 SDK. 
   Libraries built with .NET 2003 are available in the csharp/NET_2003
   subdirectory.  The ASN1C library is called asn1rt.dll.

SAMPLE PROGRAMS

   A number of sample programs are available in the sample_ber, sample_der, 
   sample_per, and sample_xer subdirectories of the installation. All the sample 
   programs workspace/solutions are created with .Net 2003 version, considering 
   the support for latest version features. 


GETTING STARTED
 
   The Employee or MyHTTP sample programs in the sample_ber area are recommended 
   for learning how the compiler works. You will need Microsoft .Net 2002 
   or greater on your system to run the samples. The samples can be built using 
   the nmake utility (or a compatible make utility) in Visual Studio .Net 
   command prompt or by running the .sln solution in Microsoft .Net 2003 
   or higher version on Windows. Most samples have a Writer.cs program to encode and write 
   a sample message to disk, and a Reader.cs program to read and decode the message. 


   Running sample programs using the Makefile: 
    
      1. Microsoft .Net 2002 or 2003 or 2005 installation required.
      2. Open the Visual Studio .Net command prompt ( Can be found at: 
         Start->Programs->Microsoft Visual Studio .Net->Visual Studio 
         .Net Tools) 
      3. Execute the nmake command to run the complete sample program 
         (makefile will call the ASN1C compiler to generate the C# code for ASN.1 
         definition, compiles the generated C# code and encode/decodes the messages)
      4. Execute the writer.exe to encode the binary message.
      5. Execute the reader.exe to decode the binary message.
    
  
   Running sample programs using the .sln solution: 
    
      1. Microsoft .Net 2003 or 2005 installation required. Note: This solution will 
         not work with Microsoft .Net 2002, 2002 user can also create the solution 
         like this.
      2. Select the Writer project in "Solution Explorer" window and 
         set it as start up project.
      3. Build the Writer project. (This will call the ASN1C compiler to generate 
         the C# code for ASN.1 definition, if necessary and compiles the generated 
         C# code with Writer.cs file)
      4. Execute the Writer project to encode the binary message.
      5. Now select the Reader project in "Solution Explorer" window 
         and set it as start up project.
      6. Build the Reader project. (This will call the ASN1C compiler to generate 
         the C# code for ASN.1 definition, if necessary and compiles the generated 
         C# code with Reader.cs file)
      7. Execute the Reader project to decode the binary message.
    

EVALUATION LICENSE

   The ASN1C compiler generates the license key in the C# code produced for 
   ASN.1 definitions. The run-time components/library of the evaluation version 
   will check this license key during encoding/decoding of the binary messages. 
   The user will not require any extra steps to set the product the license key. 

SUPPORT AND QUESTIONS

   We welcome your questions and comments on the new version of ASN1C. Please 
   send requests to info@obj-sys.com or support@obj-sys.com and we will respond
