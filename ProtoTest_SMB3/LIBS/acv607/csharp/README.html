<p>This README file contains information on the C# Run-Time components add-on 
  for ASN1C V6.0. 
<h3><A NAME="DOCUMENTATION"></A>DOCUMENTATION</h3>
<blockquote> The following documentation is available on using the C# run-time 
  code generated by ASN1C:

  <p>The MSDN style ASN1C C# runtime library documentation can be accessed through 
    the <i>ASN1C library.chm</i> file in the csharp/doc subdirectory. </p>

<H3><A NAME="CsharpSupport"></A>Microsoft .Net SUPPORT</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ASN1C run-time library is built with <i>Microsoft .Net 2005 / 2.0 SDK</i>. 
    Libraries built with <i>.NET 2003</i> are available in the <i>csharp/NET_2003</i>
    subdirectory.  The ASN1C library is called <i>asn1rt.dll</i>.</p>
</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="SamplePrograms"></A>SAMPLE PROGRAMS</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A number of sample programs are available in the sample_ber, sample_der, 
    sample_per, and sample_xer subdirectories of the installation. All the sample 
    programs workspace/solutions are created with .Net 2003 version, considering 
    the support for latest version features. 
</blockquote>

<H3><A NAME="GettingStarted"></a>GETTING STARTED</H3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The Employee or MyHTTP sample programs in the sample_ber area are recommended 
    for learning how the compiler works. You will need <i>Microsoft .Net 2002</i> 
    or greater on your system to run the samples. The samples can be built using 
    the nmake utility (or a compatible make utility) in <i>Visual Studio .Net 
    command prompt</i> or by running the .sln solution in <i>Microsoft .Net 2003</i> 
    or higher version on Windows. Most samples have a Writer.cs program to encode 
    and write a sample message to disk, and a Reader.cs program to read and decode 
    the message. 
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>Running sample programs using the Makefile: 
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft .Net 2002 or 2003 or 2005 installation required.</li>
      <li>Open the <i>Visual Studio .Net command prompt</i> ( Can be found at: 
        Start-&gt;Programs-&gt;Microsoft Visual Studio .Net-&gt;Visual Studio 
        .Net Tools) </li>
      <li>Execute the <i>nmake</i> command to run the complete sample program 
        (makefile will call the ASN1C compiler to generate the C# code for ASN.1 
        definition, compiles the generated C# code and encode/decodes the messages)</li>
      <li>Execute the <i>writer.exe</i> to encode the binary message.</li>
      <li>Execute the <i>reader.exe</i> to decode the binary message.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li>Running sample programs using the .sln solution: 
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft .Net 2003 or 2005 installation required. Note: This solution 
        will not work with Microsoft .Net 2002. </li>
      <li>Open the solution (.sln file) into Microsoft .Net 2003, by double clicking 
        the file.</li>
      <li>Select the Writer project in the &quot;Solution Explorer&quot; window 
        and set it as start up project.</li>
      <li>Build the Writer project. (This will call the ASN1C compiler to generate 
        C# code for the ASN.1 definition and compiles the generated C# code with 
        Writer.cs file)</li>
      <li>Execute the Writer project to encode the binary message.</li>
      <li>Now select the Reader project in &quot;Solution Explorer&quot; window 
        and set it as start up project.</li>
      <li>Build the Reader project. (This will call the ASN1C compiler to generate 
        C# code for the ASN.1 definition and compiles the generated C# code with 
        Reader.cs file)</li>
      <li>Execute the Reader project to decode the binary message.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="EvalLicense"></A>EVALUATION LICENSE</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The ASN1C compiler generates a license key in the C# code produced for 
  ASN.1 definitions. The run-time components/library of the evaluation version 
  will check this license key during encoding/decoding of the binary messages. 
</blockquote>
<H3><A NAME="EvalLicense"></A>SUPPORT AND QUESTIONS</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>We welcome your questions and comments on the new version of ASN1C. 
  Please send requests to info@obj-sys.com or support@obj-sys.com and we 
  will respond within two business days.
