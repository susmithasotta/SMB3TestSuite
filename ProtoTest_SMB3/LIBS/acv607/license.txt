                SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT

Objective Systems, Inc. (OSys) hereby grants the Licensee a license to use 
the ASN1C V5.xx software.  The following conditions apply to the use 
of the software:

1.  THE SOFTWARE.  The Software to which this license applies 
(the "Software"), is ASN1C.

2.  OWNERSHIP.  Objective Systems, Inc. ("OSys") is the owner of 
the Software and all copyrights in the Software.  The Software is 
protected by title 17 of the United States Code (the Copyright Act), 
and you must honor all rights established by the Copyright Act with 
respect to the Software.  The Software embodies substantial creative 
efforts and confidential information, ideas, and structure, which 
have not been revealed to the public.

3.  USE OF SOFTWARE.  Licensee may use the Software on only the computers 
for which licenses were purchased.  If a run-time license with the 
unlimited redistribution option was purchased, then applications 
built with the run-time libraries can be executed on any number of 
computers.  Licensee may copy the Software for support and backup purposes. 
Nevertheless, Licensee may not: 
(a.) use or install the Software on more than the number of computers 
the purchased license(s) allows, 
(b.) make any copies of the manual materials concerning the Software, 
(c.) modify, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, nor create 
derivative works from the Software nor merge it into any other 
program, nor 
(d.)  allow any person, including employees, to do any of these things.

 3.1 USE OF COMPILER EXECUTABLE. The Software includes one or more 
ASN1C compiler executable programs that are used to generate computer 
source code from application programs. The compiler is licensed on a 
per-computer basis. Licensee may only use the compiler to generate 
code on computers for which licenses were purchased. 

 3.2 USE OF COMPILER SOURCE CODE.  Compiler source code is not 
included in this version of this software.

 3.3 USE OF GENERATED SOURCE CODE.  This product generates 
source code that can be used to create new application Software. 
Licensee may freely modify, copy, and distribute the generated 
code without restriction.

 3.4 USE OF RUN-TIME LIBRARY BINARY CODE. The software includes 
binary run-time libraries that may be linked with application 
object code to form new application software.  Binary libraries 
and/or application software derived from these libraries may only 
be used on computers for which licenses were purchased.  Binary 
libraries may be purchased with an 'unlimited redistribution' 
option.  This allows Licensee to distribute value-added application 
software that includes binary object code from these libraries to 
an unlimited number of end users.  It does not allow the direct 
redistribution of the libraries themselves.  Licensee will own all 
rights to such application software, and Licensee will owe no fee 
for users of this software and no royalties for selling such programs.

 3.5 USE OF RUN-TIME LIBRARY SOURCE CODE.  Source code may be 
included to build binary versions of the run-time libraries.  
The source code license grants Licensee the right to develop 
executable programs (i.e., object code and programs) using the 
Software.  This source code can only be used to create binary 
libraries and/or dynamic link libraries and/or application 
programs linked with these libraries for redistribution to 
end users.  The limitations for redistribution to end users 
are the same as in paragraph 3.4.  The run-time source code 
cannot be redistribued to third parties.

4.  NO ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not transfer, lease, assign, 
sell, rent, loan, nor sublicense this license or otherwise 
encumber or transfer the Software in whole or in part, to a 
third party without the prior written consent of OSys.

5.  REVISIONS.  From time to time OSys may issue revisions of the 
Software.  Licensee shall be provided with latest revisions free 
of charge as long as Warranty (section 6) or extended support is 
not expired.  If Warranty or extended support is expired, Licensee 
may purchase revisions at current posted cost minus 50% of the 
original License cost paid by Licensee.  If a revision is received, 
Licensee agrees to replace the Software with the revised version 
and acknowledge that the update will be governed by the terms of 
this License Agreement

6.  WARRANTY.  OSys warrants to Licensee that the Software, if properly 
installed and operated on a computer for which it is designed, will 
perform substantially in accordance with the specifications set forth 
in the manual provided with the Software.

  6.1  Warranty Obligations.  During the warranty period, established 
as the initial 60 days after the date of delivery of the OSys products, 
OSys will repair or replace, at its sole option, without charge to 
Licensess any portion of the Software which does not meet the requirements 
of this warranty.  To obtain service, Licensee must notify OSys by sending 
an e-mail message to support@obj-sys.com.  Any correspondence 
requesting warranty service must include Licensee's license number and 
proof of purchase.  At its option, OSys may refund the purchase 
price for the Software instead of repairing or replacing the Software 
within the first 60 days if Licensee identifies a major problem, which is 
detrimental to the normal operation and performance of the OSys products 
and it is determined by OSys that there is no solution that can be 
implemented to solve the unique problem.

  6.2	Warranty Period.  The warranty period shall commence on the 
date the Software is purchased and continue for 60 days thereafter. 
All requests for warranty service must be received by OSys during 
the warranty period.  Any support exceeding the warranty period will 
be covered by the Initial Support, which is 180 days and begins on the 
date the OSys products are delivered. Any support exceeding the warranty 
and the Initial Support must be arranged in a special support agreement 
in the form of an extended support plan, which extends the initial support
in annual increments at twenty percent (20%) of the initial license cost.  
This entitles licensee to unlimited technical support and all latest 
revisions of the software.

  6.3	Your Responsibilities.  All warranties of the Software are 
contingent on proper use of the Software by Licensee and do not cover 
damage due to accident, unusual physical, electrical, or 
electromechanical stress, neglect, misuse, failure of electric 
power, environmental condition, transportation, operation with 
operating systems, media, other software, or hardware not approved 
by OSys, or tampering with or altering of the Software.  In addition, 
Licensee assume responsibility for the selection of the Software to 
achieve Licensee's intended results and for the installation, use, 
and results obtained from the Software.

  6.4 Bug Reports.  Any bug report has to be provied with a short, but 
complete program that shows the problem.  Licensee provides OSys with 
relevant data to reproduce the problem and with a complete description.  
OSys will not start investigation before the required programs are 
available.  OSys will not support any program that is modified by 
Licensee.  OSys will provide Licensee with all bug fix releases for any 
bugs contained in the licensed software and with all patches to the 
software it provides without charge to any of it's Licensees.

  6.5 Limits of Liability.  The remedies described in this Section 
6 are exclusive of any other remedies which you might otherwise claim.  

OSys SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF DATA, LOSS 
OF PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, 
CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR OTHER SIMILAR DAMAGES 
ARISING FROM BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, 
NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF OSys OR 
ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED 
CLAIMS BY ANY OTHER PARTY, (EXCEPT FOR THIRD 
PARTY CLAIMS AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 6.1(A) BELOW).  
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE SOFTWARE 
IS LICENSED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY 
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING 
BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability 
contained herein, so the above limitations or exclusions may not 
apply to Licensee.

LICENSEE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, 
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT OR OTHER SIMILAR 
DAMAGES ARISING FROM BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF 
CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY EVEN IF 
LICENSEE OR ITS AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY 
OTHER PARTY (EXCEPT FOR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AS SET 
FORTH IN SECTION 8 BELOW).

7.  DEFAULT AND REMEDIES.  If Licensee or any of Licensee's employees 
or agents violates or attempts to violate any provision of this Agreement 
or any copyright laws with respect to the Software, the license of the 
Software to Licensee shall automatically terminate.  Furthermore, OSys 
shall be entitled to all legal and equitable remedies including an injunction of 
any actions prohibited hereby, specific performance of Licensee's obligations 
hereunder, remedies set forth in 17 U.S.C. 501, et seq., and recovery of 
the costs of enforcing this Agreement including attorney's fees, expert 
witness fees and costs.  If any provision hereof is deemed to be 
unenforceable, then the remainder of this Agreement shall not be 
affected, and shall be enforced as if the unenforceable provision were 
not included herein.  The laws of Pennsylvania will govern this license 
agreement, except as to matter pre-empted by United States law.   
In the event of any dispute involving this license, Licensee agrees to 
exclusive jurisdiction and venue in either state or federal courts 
in Pennsylvania and agree that the prevailing party shall be entitled 
to its attorney fees and costs.

officers, directors, agents, and employees, and forever holds it harmless 
from and against all claims, suits, actions, proceedings, damages, loss
