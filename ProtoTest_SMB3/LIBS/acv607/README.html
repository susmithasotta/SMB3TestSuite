	 <BLOCKQUOTE> Thank you for downloading this release of the ASN1C software.
		ASN1C is a powerful ASN.1 compiler capable of parsing and generating C, C++,
		C#, or Java source code for the most advanced ASN.1 syntax. 
		<P> This package contains the ASN1C compiler executables and run-time
		  libraries. Documentation is available online at
		  <A HREF="http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/documents.shtml">
		  http://www.obj-sys.com/docs/documents.shtml</A> </P>

	 <H2><A NAME="WhatsNew"></A>Release Notes</H2> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> This release of ASN1C adds the following new capabilities: 
		<DL> 
		  <DT><B>Compilation of XML Schema (XSD) Files</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>The capability to generate code for XSD files has been added in
			 addition to ASN.1 files. This is accomplished by doing an internal
			 transformation of XSD-to-ASN.1 as specified in the X.694 standard. The
			 resulting types and encoders/decoders make it possible to encode data in
			 W3C-compliant XML form as well as the fast, efficient binary forms as specified
			 in the ASN.1 encoding rules standards (BER, DER, CER, or PER). 
			 <P> </P></DD> 
		  <DT><B>New Cross-Platform GUI</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>A new GUI Wizard has been added in this release that works on Linux
			 and some UNIX platforms in addition to Windows. The layout of the GUI has been
			 changed in an attempt to group related options in a logical way. Source code
			 for the GUI is included in the package to allow customization to a particular
			 style if desired. 
			 <P> </P></DD> 
		  <DT><B>Use of an XML Pull-Parser for C/C++ Decoding</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>The generated C/C++ XML code has been changed to use a custom-built
			 pull parser for C/C++ decoding of XML files. This is commonly known in other
			 XML libraries as a reader interface. This replaces the generation of SAX
			 handling code which proved to be awkward in preserving state between
			 operations. The newly generated code is much more efficient and performs much
			 better than the SAX code of past releases. 
			 <P>Note that this just refers to code generated when the <I>-xml</I>
				option is specified, not <I>-xer</I>. Generated XER code still uses the SAX
				interface.</P> 
			 <P></P></DD> 
		  <DT><B>Redesign of C++ Encode/Decode Stream Classes</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>C++ stream classes for BER/DER/CER and XER were redesigned to use
			 common stream classes internally instead of inherting from them. This provided
			 a cleaner interface for working with the streams and separated the
			 encode/decode functionality for the individual encoding rules from the stream
			 transport mechanics. 
			 <P> </P></DD> 
		  <DT><B>Generation of Visual Studio project files</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>The generate VC project option (<I>-vcproj</I>) has been added to
			 allow generation of Visual Studio project files. These allow a user who is
			 familair with Visual Studio to get up and running quickly by generating both
			 the code and project files necessary to build the project from a given set of
			 XSD or ASN.1 schemas. 
			 <P> </P></DD> 
		  <DT><B>Additional Makefile / VC Project options</B> </DT> 
		  <DD>The DLL (<I>-dll</I>) and multi-threaded (<I>-mt</I>) options make
			 it possible to generate makefiles and/or Visual Studio project files that will
			 link against DLL's or add multi-threaded compialtion options respectively. 
			 <P> </P></DD> 
		</DL></BLOCKQUOTE> 
	 <H2><A NAME="CodeGenChanges"></A>Compatibility</H2> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> In an ongoing effort to improve the product, changes have been
		made in how code is generated in some cases. Version 6.0 is a major new release
		level and, as such, much has changed. In order to implement the compilation of
		XSD files, much of the code from our <I>XBinder</I> project had to be
		integrated with ASN1C. This resulted in a new name scheme for common types and
		for the use of many internal run-time functions. 
		<P>Users of previous versions of the compiler can achieve backward
		  compatility with their existing code bases in several different ways:</P> 
		<OL> 
		  <LI>By running a Perl script - <I>rtport.pl</I> - that is included in
			 the top level directory of the installation. This will edit an existing source
			 file and change all of the names necessary to make it compatible with the 6.0
			 version of ASN1C.</LI> 
		  <LI>By adding the <I>asn1compat.h</I> header file to an existing
			 application that uses ASN1C generated or run-time code. This header file
			 contains macro definitions that convert the old names into the new naming
			 scheme.</LI> 
		  <LI>By using the compiler <I>-compat</I> switch (for example, '-compat
			 5.6' will generate code compatible with the 5.6 version of the compiler). Note
			 that for version 6.0, it will also be necessary to do step 1 or 2 in addition
			 to using <I>-compat</I> to generate compatible code.</LI>

	 <H2><A NAME="WindowsInstall"></A>Windows Installation</H2> 
	 <BLOCKQUOTE> 
		<P>The steps to install ASN1C on a Windows system are as follows:</P> 
		<OL> 
		  <LI>Download the ASN1C package that is of interest to you. Packages are
			 available online for C/C++, C#, and Java. The C/C++ package contains run-time
			 libraries built with the Microsoft Visual C++ v6.0, v7.0 (.NET 2003), and v8.0
			 (VS 2005) compilers, the Borland v5.5 C++ compiler, and the GNU Cygwin 3.3.1
			 compiler. 
			 <P></P></LI> 
		  <LI>ASN1C for Windows is packaged in a self-extracting executable file
			 format. To install, all that should be necessary is to double-click this file
			 after downloading and then following the setup wizard instructions from that
			 point. 
			 <P></P></LI> 
		  <LI>After installation is complete, the license file must be installed
			 to allow the product to operate. This was sent in the <TT>osyslic.txt</TT> file
			 that was attached to the E-mail message that was sent at the time the product
			 was downloaded. If you did not receive a license file, please contact us. 
			 <P></P></LI> 
		  <LI>The <TT>osyslic.txt</TT> file must be copied to a location where
			 the compiler can find it. This can be done in one of the following ways: 
			 <P></P> 
			 <DL> 
				<DT><B>a.</B> The file can be copied to the same directory that the
				  ASN1C compiler executable file is located in. This is in the bin subdirectory
				  located under the top-level install directory. This is the preferred option as
				  it keeps the license separate from other similar license files that may be
				  present on a given computer system.</DT> 
				<DT><B>b.</B> The file can be copied into any of the directories
				  specified within your PATH environment variable (copying to the c:\windows
				  directory works on most systems), or </DT> 
				<DT><B>c.</B> The file can be copied to a different directory and
				  an environment variable named <I>OSLICDIR</I> created to point at this
				  directory location.</DT> 
			 </DL> 
			 <P>Note that licenses from versions of ASN1C older than 5.7 are not
				compatible with this release of the product. </P> 
			 <P>The compiler should now be operational. The following command can
				be executed: </P> 
			 <BLOCKQUOTE> <TT>&lt;rootdir&gt;\bin\asn1c</TT> </BLOCKQUOTE>

		<DL> 
		  <DT><TT>&lt;installdir&gt;\bin\asn1c.exe</TT> </DT> 
		  <DD>The command-line compiler executable file. This is invoked on ASN.1

			 functions. It is recommended you modify your PATH environment variable to
			 include <TT>&lt;installdir&gt;\bin</TT> to allow the compiler executable to be
			 run from anywhere. 
			 <P></P></DD> 
		  <DT><TT>&lt;installdir&gt;\bin\asn1cGUI.exe</TT> </DT> 
		  <DD>The compiler graphic user interface (GUI) wizard executable file.
			 This GUI guides a user through the process of specifying ASN.1 or XSD source

			 the DLL. There is also a static library for direct linkage to the object
			 modules (this is the library file with the '_a.lib' suffix). The static library
			 included in the evaluation version is not thread-safe. The licensed version of
			 the product also contains a thread-safe static library (compiled with -MT
			 option) and a DLL-ready library (compiled with -MD option) for building your
			 own value-added DLL's. Also note that the evaluation and development libraries
			 are not fully optimized (they contain diagnostic tracing and are not compiled
			 with compiler optimization turned on). The deployment libraries are fully
